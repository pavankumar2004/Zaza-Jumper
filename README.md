# ðŸ§± Zaza Jumper

**Zaza Jumper** is a chaotic cube-hopping adventure where gravity is your frenemy and platforms exist purely to humble you.  
You play as **Zaza** â€” a brave, bouncy block with dreams of vertical greatness.  
Leap, flop, and fall with style in this physics-defying platformer made entirely with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and the tears of debugging.
